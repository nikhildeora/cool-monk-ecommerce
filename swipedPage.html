        <h3>@sweety : Takes the Stress edge off well</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></p>
        <p>With a few businesses and an infant, I tend to be under a lot of stress most of the time and when I am stressed for a long period of time I become very irritable and "snappy" at times. I took this product because it was new and honestly didn't think it would help, but at least I could say I tried it. After about 2 weeks of taking it every day I noticed the things that would normally make me vent out my frustrations (like the things we say out loud to our dashboards when we are in traffic), I wasn't venting nearly as much. I found myself being more laid back which is not what I'm use to feeling. I will buy these again. If you have a lot of stress, definitely give these a try for a month</p>

        <h3>@rohan1994: very helpful</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></p>
        <p>I just started using this product a few days ago and find it very stabilizing. I take it at lunch time and it keeps me steady and calm and therefore, focused and accomplished during the rest of my day. I am very much enjoying adding it to my regimen. Now I am using it daily. I love that the ingredients are Magnesium, Saffron and GABA. Such a great combination. So grateful for this product.</p>

        <h3>@mitesh23 : Not that good product</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></p>
        <p>I stopped taking mid month because I experienced bloating and water retention. Was doing great until I started this. Went off and I'm feeling better already</p>

        <h3>2. What are the four main bioactive compounds found in saffron and what do they do?</h3>
        <p>  Saffron contains compounds that function as antioxidants, crocin, crocetin, kaempferol and safranal, which protect cells from oxidative stress. Saffron gets its yellow coloring from crocin and crocetin, which may also support emotional wellness and serotonin levels which plays a role in healthy appetite and productivity. The bitter and distinct taste is provided by safranal, which may also support a healthy emotional disposition and help maintain normal memory. Kaempferol supports a healthy immune response and combats free radicals.</p>

        <h3>3. What are signs that you may be magnesium deficient?</h3>
        <p>  Magnesium is an essential mineral that can be found in many dairy and fiber-rich foods. Symptoms that you may have low levels of magnesium are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle twitching or muscle soreness. Excessive amounts of sugar and caffeine or stress can deplete magnesium. Low levels of magnesium affect calcium absorption, and both are essential for bone health</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>4. What types of foods are the best source of magnesium and how common are magnesium deficiencies ?</h3>
        <p>  Organic or all naturally grown fibrous and dairy-rich foods are a greater source of magnesium in comparison to non-organic-grown foods. Calcium supplements taken in conjunction with magnesium supplements help the body to better absorb both, better than when taken alone. While magnesium deficiencies can be difficult to detect since most of the magnesium in the body is not located in the blood, studies project that as many as ¾ of Americans are acquiring less than the daily recommended intake of magnesium</p>

        <h3>5. Why are dopamine and serotonin important</h3>
        <p>Neurotransmitters, like dopamine and serotonin, are recognized as happy hormones because they produce positive emotions. Serotonin and dopamine work together to provide the body with a chemical balance. While dopamine regulates mood, playing a role in pleasure and reward, low levels of dopamine may result in a lack of motivation and difficulty concentrating or difficulties regulating a healthy mood. Dopamine is associated with rewards, productivity, and motivation. Serotonin is stored in the gut and helps to regulate mood, body temperature and appetite. Other factors such as genetics, environment and health habits also affect mood. Exercise, yoga and meditation may improve your mood and increase serotonin and dopamine levels which enhance mood naturally.</p>
